**Note**
* This script doesn't work on Windows machines. It works on both Linux and Mac OS. If you are using it on linux change [[:<:]] with \b 

* You will need the .raw files (one per chromosome)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..29} ; do
	tail -n +2 chr${i}.raw > file_flipped
	cut -f 7- -d ' ' file_flipped > SNPs
	cut -f2 -d ' ' file_flipped > ID
	sed -i -e "s/[[:<:]]NA[[:>:]]/9/g" SNPs
	paste -d ' ' ID SNPs > ch${i}_coded
	rm ID SNPs file_flipped SNPs-e
done

```


### Explanation

The script will produce :

* 29 files (the sexual chromosomes are not included) ready for the Imputation. You can use these files in the script mask_genotypes.
* The missing values are coded as 9. The files are space delimited file.
